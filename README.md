# admin-dashboard
I am going to build a layout for an admin dashboard. 
Will need to use Grid as much as possible for layout. 

1. build html structure with a little bit of dummy text content provided. 
Need to make sure that
html items are nested correctly so that grid can be created without moving html
element around. 
2. set up grid structure of the general layout. 
3. fill up dummy content text with icons and pictures give items some color. 
4. create the grid for inside of the the elements and make them look good.
